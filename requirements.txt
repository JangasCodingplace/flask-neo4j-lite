# The base set of requirements for REST framework is actually
# just Django, but for the purposes of development and testing
# there are a number of packages that are useful to install.

# Laying these out as separate requirements files, allows us to
# only included the relevant sets when running tox, and ensures
# we are only ever declaring our dependencies in one place.
